Database protocol
=================
A database query is done through a Remote Procedure Call (see README.rpc).
A query is always done to a remote procedure, ad-hoc SQL queries are not
supported.

Request
-------
The function name for the Remote Procedure Call is the name of the Remote
Procedure. Parameters follow the function name until the end of the message.

Response
--------
An error is recorded in the result code in the RPC message. It is followed
by zero or more results until the end of the message.

A result can be either a single value (integer, float, string, byte array) or a table (list)

Table
-----
A table is a list type, the first entry in the list is the table header, which
is followed by rows.

Table header
------------
A table header is a list with column names with string types.

Row
---
A row is a list with values (integer, float, string, byte array, list, dictionary).
The list and dictionary types are used when a column has a compound type.
